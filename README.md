Project Name: Dungeon Data

Developers: David Marchante, Kush Shrestha, Chaitanya Narukulla, William Fritts

Description: 
  This application will serve as a user hub for dungeon masters to be able to obtain the most recent monster information on playing cards. The user will be able to enter their location and be given a listing of current events/news in their location. The user will be able to scroll through the monster compendium. 

Problem Domain:
  One of the big problems with card-based games is that as cards are updated, users are required to buy new cards in order to keep up to date with their monsters’ abilities. This application will solve that problem by pulling current information from the API and displaying up to date monster information in the form of digital cards which the user can flip through. The user will have the ability to favorite cards which can be their most frequently used/visited cards.

User stories
  MVP User Stories
    As a user, I'd like to find a welcome page that is clearly designed so I can find the information I am looking for.
    As a user, I'd like to be able to easily find information about the creators of the application.
    As a user, I'd like to be able to find game information in case I need to reference a rule and even learn about the game for the first time.
    As a user, I'd like to have live updated cards for the dungeon master to refer to during game play versus flipping through cards.
    As a user, I'd like to be able to search for any card beyond the cards initially presented to me. 
  Stretch Goal User Stories 
    As a user, I’d like to know about current and upcoming events – google api for user location
    As a user, I'd like to be able to filter the cards by abilities or other monster details.
    As a user, I'd like to be able to sort the cards by monster.

Conflict plan
  What will your group do when it encounters conflict?
    Majority vote determines course of action
  How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
    Communication. As we’re all adults, it shouldn’t be an issue to directly communicate with any trouble that arises. Address cordially person to person initially. If trouble continues, involve group. If trouble continues, involve TA or instructor. 
  What is your process to resolve conflicts?
    Approach problem head on, one on one. Involve group if need arises. Involve TA’s/instructor if mechanisms require. 
  How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful?
    First level of escalation is to the full group. Problems should be taken to full group for vote immediately if one on one cannot be resolved. If there is still issue after group vote, TA’s/Instructor should be requested for mediation immediately. Better to resolve any conflict as soon as possible to prevent prolonged disruption to project. 

Communication Plan
  How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
    Communication after hours will be through the group slack channel. 
  What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard?
    Round table discussion on feature aspects. 
  How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
    Everyone will have a chance to speak up, all opinions will be sought before decisions are finalized. Ultimately, a group vote will determine a course of action. 

Project Scope
  The MVP for this project is to give the user access to monster cards created from the dungeons and dragon’s API data which allows for current monster information versus a static physical deck of cards which could potentially be outdated with updates. The user will have the ability to favorite cards which will be displayed first at the top of the page underneath the current events based off of the user’s location. 



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
